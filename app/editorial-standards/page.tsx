      <p>
        Peptips publishes educational content about GLP-1 medications. The
        reader trust we need to earn is different from other health-adjacent
        sites, so our rules are stricter. Here&apos;s how we work.
      </p>

      <h2>We are not a clinic</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Nothing on this site is medical advice.
        </strong>{" "}
        We describe what studies, FDA labels, manufacturer documents, and
        peer-reviewed papers have published. We do not diagnose, treat, cure,
        or prevent any disease or condition. Always consult your healthcare
        provider before starting, stopping, or changing any medication.
      </p>

      <h2>Sourcing</h2>
      <p>
        Every factual claim about a specific drug, dose, or side effect on this
        site is cited to one of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An FDA-approved prescribing information document (the label)</li>
        <li>A peer-reviewed trial published in an indexed medical journal</li>
        <li>A manufacturer&apos;s public technical document</li>
        <li>A regulatory or government document (FDA, EMA, CDC, NIH)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For any significant health claim, we prefer two independent sources:
        one primary study plus one regulatory or manufacturer reference. When
        evidence is genuinely mixed, we say so in the text. We don&apos;t pretend to
        have certainty we don&apos;t have.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of generic and brand names</h2>
      <p>
        We always use the generic name alongside the brand name, especially in
        the first mention of a post. &quot;Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy)&quot; and
        &quot;tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound),&quot; always both. This is for accuracy
        and for accessibility when readers are comparing what their doctor
        prescribed against what we&apos;ve written.
      </p>

      <h2>No telehealth recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        We describe the telehealth landscape neutrally when relevant. We do
        not recommend specific telehealth providers. We will never link a
        reader to a telehealth clinic for commercial purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Corrections</h2>
      <p>
        When we&apos;re wrong, we want to know. When we fix a factual error, we:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Correct the text</li>
        <li>Add a dated correction note at the bottom of the post</li>
        <li>Don&apos;t silently edit — the history stays visible</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Email corrections to hello@peptips.com. We respond within 5 business
        days.
      </p>

      <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2>
      <p>
        Peptips does not accept payment from drug manufacturers. Peptips does
        not accept payment from telehealth clinics in exchange for editorial
        coverage. When we link to a supplement brand (protein powder,
        electrolytes, fiber) we may earn an affiliate commission, and we
        disclose it on every page where it applies, above the product list, in
        plain English.
      </p>

      <h2>AI and our editorial process</h2>
      <p>
        We use AI tools in parts of our workflow: literature synthesis, draft
        generation, grammar checks, formatting. Every post on this site is
        reviewed, fact-checked, and edited by a human before publication. No
        post is published that hasn&apos;t been through that review.
      </p>
      <p>
        When AI tooling is used in a way that materially shapes a post&apos;s
        conclusions, we say so explicitly.
      </p>

      <h2>Images and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We do not publish before/after photos, weight-loss numbers, or
        body-focused imagery. These are platform compliance landmines, and
        they invite the wrong reader.
      </p>

      <h2>What we don&apos;t do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don&apos;t accept payment for editorial placement</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t publish content written by drug manufacturers</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t use words like &quot;miracle,&quot; &quot;secret,&quot; or &quot;shocking&quot;</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t write fake urgency, fake scarcity, or fake reviews</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t tell readers to start or stop any medication</li>
      </ul>
