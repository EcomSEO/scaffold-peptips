 * Locale routing for peptips.com.
 *
 * Twelve locales: English (default, root path) plus German, French, Italian,
 * Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Portuguese (PT-PT), Romanian, Czech, and
 * Norwegian Bokmål. Adding a new locale = drop another code into `locales`,
 * add a matching dictionary file in `i18n/dictionaries/<code>.json`, and add
 * an entry to `POST_I18N` plus the `i18n` blocks on `site.ts` / `hubs.ts`.
 *
 * Default locale (`en`) renders at the root path; other locales are prefixed
 * — `/de`, `/de/<slug>`, `/fr/guides/<hub>`, etc. Slugs stay in English for
 * phase one. Translated slugs are a later phase.
